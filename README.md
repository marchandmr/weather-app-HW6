# weather-app-HW6

I was tasked with creating a weather dashboard that would not only show the current forecast for a city entered by the user but would also show the extended forecast. To accomplish this, I used the open weather API to pull all the necessary data to premade div.’s and cards, I created in the html. I then used the .empty() function to clear all of the data stored when the submit button is pressed so the application can run again, without any spill over from previous searches. I also saved the previous search into an array and appended it as a button to an ul element under the text box.
